    <h1>London Bridges</h1>
    <h2>Tower Bridge</h2>

    <p>Tower Bridge is a movable bridge that spans the River Thames between the Greater London boroughs of Tower Hamlets
        and Southwark. It’s an iconic landmark that aesthetically complements the Tower of London, to which it adjoins.
        The bridge, completed in 1894, combines two systems: swingarm and suspension. Its twin towers rise 61 meters
        (200 feet) above the river, and glass-covered walkways offer stunning views for tourists. Although originally
        designed for pedestrians to cross even when raised, they were closed from 1909 to 1982 due to safety concerns.
        The bridge’s steam-powered operation transitioned to electric motors in 1976, but today, the leaves are seldom
        raised due to reduced shipping at the London Docklands</p>
    <h2>Millenium Bridge</h2>

    <p>The Millennium Bridge, officially known as the London Millennium Footbridge, is a steel suspension bridge for
        pedestrians crossing the River Thames in London, England. It links Bankside with the City of London and is owned
        and maintained by Bridge House Estates, a charitable trust overseen by the City of London Corporation. The
        bridge opened on June 10, 2000 and spans 325 meters (1,066 feet), providing a picturesque view of St. Paul’s
        Cathedral from across the river. Initially nicknamed the “Wobbly Bridge” due to swaying motion on its opening
        day, it underwent modifications and repairs before reopening in February 2002. The southern end of the bridge is
        near the Globe Theatre, Bankside Gallery, and Tate Modern, while the northern end is next to the City of London
        School below St. Paul’s Cathedral. Its innovative design features supporting cables below the deck level,
        creating a shallow profile and allowing for unobstructed views.
